# Shape Viewer Application

## Overview
The **Shape Viewer Application** is a client-side tool designed to create, view, and manage geometric shapes dynamically. It is built using **React.js**, styled with **CSS**, and provides a seamless user interface for working with shapes. Users can load shapes from a `.shapefile`, create new shapes, modify them, and save the updated file. The application is responsive and works across devices of various sizes.

   - Dynamic color palette for selecting shape colors.

# Challenges and Solutions

## Overview
During the development of the Shape Viewer Application, we faced several challenges related to shape rendering, rotation, file handling, and UI integration. Below is a detailed account of these challenges and how they were overcome.

---

## Challenges and Solutions

### 1. Shape Rotation for Triangles and Polygons
**Challenge:**  
- Handling the rotation of triangles and polygons was particularly tricky as their geometries dynamically change based on rotation angles.
- For triangles, incorrect vertex calculations often led to rendering issues, creating unintended polygons or shapes with more than three sides.

**Solution:**  
- The centroid of each shape was calculated dynamically as the pivot point for rotation.
- For triangles, the logic ensured only the first three vertices were considered, maintaining their structure during rotation.
- Adjustments were made to handle edge cases, such as shapes with overlapping vertices or rotations exceeding 360Â°.

---

### 2. Save As Functionality
**Challenge:**  
- Accurately saving shapes to a `.shapefile` while preserving their properties like rotation, color, and dimensions.
- Initial implementations failed to handle rotation or reconstruct polygons accurately when the saved file was reopened.

**Solution:**  
- Extended the save logic to dynamically include rotation data and ensured that polygon vertices were preserved correctly.
- Introduced a user-friendly file-saving process, prompting for custom filenames and locations while using the `file-saver` library.

---

### 3. Dragging and Translating Shapes
**Challenge:**  
- Implementing drag-and-drop functionality without distorting shape properties such as rotation or dimensions.
- Handling dynamic adjustments for triangles and polygons during movement.

**Solution:**  
- Developed a robust dragging mechanism using event handlers, ensuring that the translation of shapes did not affect their rotation or original dimensions.
- Adjusted the logic for polygons and triangles to correctly update their positions without altering vertex relationships.

---

### 4. Handling Diverse Input Formats
**Challenge:**  
- Managing different input formats in `.shapefile` files, including optional rotation data and inconsistent casing for shape types.
- Ensuring backward compatibility with previously saved files.

**Solution:**  
- Standardized input processing by converting all shape types to capitalized format internally.
- Enhanced file parsing logic to handle optional properties dynamically without breaking.

---

### 5. UI Challenges with Graph Background
**Challenge:**  
- Integrating a graph-like background in the viewport without affecting shape rendering or performance.
- Maintaining visibility and clarity of shapes over the background.

**Solution:**  
- Implemented a CSS grid background with subtle colors for contrast.
- Ensured that shapes were rendered above the background with clear strokes and fill colors.

---

## Conclusion
Despite the challenges faced, each problem was systematically analyzed and resolved, leading to a robust and user-friendly application. This project stands as a testament to the importance of problem-solving and iterative development in software engineering.
